## Introduction

**JavaScript On/Off** is a lightweight and efficient Chrome extension that allows you to effortlessly toggle JavaScript execution on or off for any website. Whether you're a developer looking to debug, a privacy enthusiast aiming to enhance security, or someone who prefers a cleaner browsing experience, this extension provides the control you need with just a single click.

In a landscape crowded with bloated extensions offering numerous features, **JavaScript On/Off** stays true to its core functionalityâ€”delivering a reliable JavaScript switcher without unnecessary complexity.

## Features

- **Simple Toggle:** Easily enable or disable JavaScript on any website with a single click.
- **Visual Indicators:** The extension icon changes color to reflect the current state:
  - **Green:** JavaScript is enabled.
  - **Red:** JavaScript is blocked.
  - **Gray:** Default setting is active.
- **Automatic Updates:** Icons update in real-time as you navigate between tabs and windows.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource usage ensures your browser remains fast and responsive.
- **Easy Installation:** Available on the Chrome Web Store and GitHub for local installation.

## How It Works

The extension utilizes Chrome's `contentSettings` API to manage JavaScript execution on a per-site basis. When you toggle JavaScript for a website:

1. **Retrieve Current Settings:** It checks the current JavaScript setting (`allow`, `block`, or `default`) for the active site.
2. **Toggle Setting:** It switches the setting between `allow` and `block`.
3. **Update Icon:** The extension icon updates to reflect the new state.
4. **Reload Tab:** The current tab reloads to apply the new JavaScript setting immediately.

This streamlined approach ensures that you have precise control over JavaScript execution without the need for additional configurations or permissions.

## Permissions

**JavaScript On/Off** requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- **`contentSettings`**: To modify JavaScript execution settings for specific websites.
- **`tabs`**: To access information about the open tabs and perform actions like reloading them.
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active tab.

These permissions are essential for the extension to provide its core functionality of toggling JavaScript on a per-site basis.
